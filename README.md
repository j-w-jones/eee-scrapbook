# EEE ScrapBook
This site is intended as a general storage area for information / experiments / snippets of code that I have found useful over the years.

It is organised into a number of sections:

- Linux Tricks
  - [Setting up Swansea VPN](linux-tricks/setup-vpn.md)
- Raspberry Pi Tricks
  - [Setting up EduRoam](raspberry-pi-tricks/setup-eduroam.md)
  - [Sharing a Network connection](raspberry-pi-tricks/share-connection.md)
